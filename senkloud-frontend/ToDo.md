- fullscreen doesnt work on mobile phnoes, for i wished it to be like how youtube videos take fullscreen on mobile phones, when the button is pressed, it rotates the screen into fullscreen landscape mode

- i wanna implement the next feature properly so that i can continously keep playing the videos within the sequence in the folder eg cowboy bepop s1, if i start with episode 1, and press next the next episode in its sequence episode to should follow, insshort in an ascending order, observe the whole system to see the file strutcure and how it orders items and add accordingly

-next episode logic:
 for the playing media in the respective containing play file,play all media sequentially

 - folder creation  doesnt work ,in the front end
